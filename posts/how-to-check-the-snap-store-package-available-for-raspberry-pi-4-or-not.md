Ubuntu built the snap store package Eco-system. The Snap store help to distribute your Linux base application and software across the Linux distro.

For checking the binary, you do not need any command. You need only two things. First is a web browser and a mouse.

There is two binary support by raspberry pi 4. first is **arm64** and **armhf**. If one of the binary is present, you can install the package in your raspberry pi 4 without any problem.

2. Second way



> In this article, I use the snap chromium package for example purpose.
